planning by action - 5.75 hours of try, find problems, build structure. general solution

Simple structure : 1.25 hours (including breaks)

	- landing page : button, top layer
	- game page with menu and matrix : done matrix, side-bar, randomise matrix, including “scroll adjustment”, clouds, trees, 

	30 minutes : matrix
		- matrix and side-bar divs
		- matrix, 2 loops
		- randomise for user
		- scroll adjustment
	30 minutes : Elements
		- trees, bush, clouds, wall
		- putting all different bricks (kind of matrix parts), together

Game : 2.5 hours (including breaks)

	- tools and clicks, and “bricks storage”. 
	- game functionality by rules : few functions, click response

	10 minutes : Layout
		- structure : tools, storage (no design)
	30 minutes : Function 1
		- function : choosing a tool with assign to certain kind of brick
	30 minutes : Function 2
		- function : removing a piece to storage + initialising storage
	30 minutes : Function 3
		- function : putting a brick back in the world 
		- where is allowed - touching ground, gravity

Finish structure : 2 hours (including breaks)
	
	- responsiveness : landing page + game
	- extra worlds and tools ( based on existing functions and matrix )
	- design landing page and game details
	- full design

	15 minutes :
	 	- responsiveness 
	30 minutes :
		- full design :  images, background, buttons
	30 minutes :
		- extra worlds - “sea” (background blue , fish , pieces of wood & algae )
	30 minutes :
		- extra tools, images, more brick types, pointer, burger-menu

Simple structure : 1.25 hours (including breaks)

matrix - with a lot of effort i made it work by schedule. all done. 

elements - managed to locate starting points for elements. not created elements yet(not complicated). 


COMMENTS

- important question : how do I choose certain cells ? maybe by creating arrays… it can be simpler… food for thought. -?- 
	solution - class. ‘queryselector’ of all makes an array to work with -!-
- How long to finish elements structure and location ?



Game : 2.5 hours (including breaks)

Layout - finished as I wanted but took 30 minutes, and not 10. satisfied with the result. had to make some design and not only divs.

Function 1 - not done. had to make some adjustments to be able to select every brick separately. now I’m happy with the structure. took 30 minutes to make - DELAY
Function 1 AGAIN - true and false for tools. activate storage counter - Done ! now I can choose bricks by background color 
Function 2 -  removing a piece to storage + initialising storage. all Done. I want to initialise ‘current holder’ - extra 10 minutes
Function 3 - where is allowed to put bricks and take them out? some ‘rules’. now there is no option to take out a dirt brick if it has any brick on top


COMMENTS

- too long for the Layout, how does that affect my schedule?
- work to make in structure - be able to choose every brick separately. DELAY in-between stage
- I want to initialise ‘current holder’ - extra 10 minutes
- added Gravity. it took about 30 minutes. i should add it to the instructions. 



Finish structure : 2 hours (including breaks)


responsiveness - at the moment it is all responsive
full-design - images, background, buttons . 


COMMENTS
- an hour Delay making background with colours and also images. 
- landing page was smooth
- worked for 2 hours on design. wasn’t efficient but nearly done including  pages for the landing page. 


LEFT TD

-responsiveness
-elements for game
-go over full assignment details
-arrange file
-start extra stuff and special effects

before submitting, some thoughts :

	the good - I was working consistently, mostly sufficient, calm and smart. and learning anything I can and put effort.

	the not good: 
		1 - I was doing design without limits, therefor it took me ages, at least half of the time. and if I would put less time, it still would have been not far from the final result.
		2 - towards the night, i realised i wasn’t planning properly the js file, so i decided to change it all. i had a feeling it would come to this much earlier, but i wanted the challenge. then i decided to make everything excellent and not only problem solving, which took me hours to re-do. it was fun, but i could have done it from the beginning.

	i learned so much in this project. even though i lost a night of sleep, and tomorrow there is study….

wonderful times
